This code builds a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transliteration model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM, GRU, or vanilla RNN. 
The model converts Hindi words written in the Latin script (e.g., dil) into the correct Devanagari script (e.g., दिल).
This is a character-level translation task.
